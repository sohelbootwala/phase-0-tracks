# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control is a way of making different versions of the same repositories so you can make changes to see how they work. You might try to work towards a common goal with a group of people, or you could take the code in a completely different direction. I'm important for collaboration, and working on large scale projects. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? Branches are used to take snapshots of what you are working on at given momment. Lets say you are trying to build a house. You can take a snapshot of the house with you working on just the kitchen which would be one branch. Then you could make another branch for the master bedroom, balconey, and guest room. And this would allow you to work on each one of them independently before merging them to make it your home.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? It is when you are saving a permaent change that you can reference, it has your name/user name, time, and the notes you made. This is cool because if you changed something and now want to see how it was before you could always revert back to see exactly what you added or deleted. 
* What is a merge conflict? Merge conflict is telling you something does not fit when you are merging the two branches together.
