# Reflection Section
# In the state_data file, the hash for the states is the key, while all of the population
# data is used as the key. In the nested hash which contains both population and population density, 
# which each serves as a key, followed by their respective values.

# require_relative essentially links to the indicated file and allows all of that code
# to be accessible within the file

# You can iterate through a hash using a do loop. You can also use .map and .each

# In refactoring virus_effects, I noticed that the method didn't take any arguments, so it wasn't necessary to define them within the method

# I think I now understand how to create code that is DRY and how to iterate over a hash
